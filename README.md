### 📊 Data Visualization

* Leveraged **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create insightful univariate and bivariate plots.
* Visualized key variables influencing default rates.

### 🔍 Data Analysis

* **Univariate Analysis:** Assessed distributions and outlier behavior in individual features.
* **Bivariate Analysis:** Explored relationships between variables (e.g., income vs credit amount).
